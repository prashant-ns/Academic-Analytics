# Academic-Analytics in Python
Project Description
In the data folder of this repository, you will find a number of .csv files. They contain data* exported from a number of third-party tools (described below) which one of our newer schools uses to manage their teachers, students, and relationships with parents.
Right now, the Higher Ground team has very little visibility into how this new school is performing, and whether there are any interventions needed to ensure both our students and our teachers are having a good experience.
Your goal is to build a dashboard which helps us understand both student performance, and whether we are allocating teachers effectively.
The main questions we want to answer are:
1. What is the distribution of grades among the student body?
2. Which teachers have more students who are struggling (average grade of D or below) than
average?
You'll also find some additional questions we're interested in at the bottom of this document, if you have extra time or want to think through where the dashboard should go.
This can be a vast undertaking. Part of the challenge is finding ways to get close to the above goal in a short amount of time, providing some value quickly. We aren't expecting a perfect dashboard, but it should ideally surface some insight, and be built in a way which will allow us to easily update it in future.
